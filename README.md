# Image Caption Generation Model

## Overview

This repository provides an **Image Caption Generation Model** that combines computer vision and natural language processing to generate captions for images. The model uses a pre-trained **Inception-ResNet-V2** for image feature extraction and a **GRU-based** architecture with **Attention** to generate meaningful captions from the extracted features.

## Key Features

- **Pre-trained Feature Extractor**: Utilizes **Inception-ResNet-V2** for extracting rich image features.
- **Attention Mechanism**: A GRU-based decoder with an **Attention mechanism** to improve caption accuracy by focusing on relevant parts of the image.
- **Text Processing**: The captions are preprocessed by tokenizing and adding special tokens to maintain structure.
- **Trained on COCO**: The model is trained on the **COCO Captions dataset**, one of the most widely used datasets for image captioning tasks.

## How It Works

1. **Image Feature Extraction**: The model first extracts high-level features from images using **Inception-ResNet-V2** (pre-trained on ImageNet). This step allows the model to understand the content of the image.
  
2. **Caption Generation**: The model uses a **GRU-based** decoder, which generates a sequence of words based on the image features. The **Attention mechanism** helps the model focus on specific parts of the image to make the generated captions more relevant.

3. **Training Process**: The model is trained using the **COCO Captions dataset**, which contains images paired with detailed captions. The training process adjusts the model to better understand the correlation between image features and textual descriptions.

4. **Generating Captions**: Once trained, the model can generate captions for any input image. The model uses the `<start>` token to begin caption generation and stops when it reaches the `<end>` token.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/image-captioning.git
    cd image-captioning
    ```

2. Install the necessary dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install tensorflow matplotlib
    ```

## Usage

1. Download the **COCO Captions** dataset for training (if not already downloaded).
2. Run the `model.py` script to train the model. It will save the trained model to a file named `image_caption_model.h5`.
3. Use the `predict_caption()` function to generate captions for new images. Simply provide the path to the image you'd like to caption.


## Future Improvements

- **Streamlit Integration**: Currently, the model is implemented via a Python script. You can easily integrate a **Streamlit** UI to allow users to upload images and generate captions through a web interface.
- **Fine-tuning**: The model can be fine-tuned on a different dataset to improve performance for specific image domains, such as medical images or product images.
