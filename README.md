# Image Captioning Model 
This project implements an attention-based image captioning model using Keras and TensorFlow. The model takes an image as input and generates a textual description of the content. It is based on the "Show, Attend and Tell" architecture, which utilizes an encoder-decoder architecture with an attention mechanism.

## Features:
* Pre-trained InceptionResNetV2 for image feature extraction
* Attention mechanism for focusing on relevant image regions during caption generation
* TextVectorization for efficient text processing
* Beam search for improved caption quality

## Datasets:
* COCO captions dataset for training and validation

## Requirements:
* TensorFlow >= 2.0
* Keras
* NumPy
* Matplotlib

## Instructions:

* Clone the repository: <br>
  ``git clone https://github.com/[your-username]/attention-image-captioning.git``

* Install dependencies

* Download the COCO captions dataset: <br>
  Follow the instructions on the COCO website to download the dataset and extract the images and captions.

* Run the training script

* Generate captions for images

## Example Output:

## Additional Notes:
This is a basic implementation of an image captioning model. Further improvements can be made by using more advanced architectures, optimizing hyperparameters, and using larger datasets.
Feel free to modify the code and experiment with different configurations.
